# Bypassing-Security-Project-2-
This project demonstrates how weak passwords and unencrypted communication protocols can be exploited using tools like Hashcat, John the Ripper, and Wireshark. It covers password cracking (brute-force and dictionary attacks) and network traffic analysis (HTTP, SSH, and FTP).

Project Overview

1. Cracking Passwords (Brute-Force Method)
â€¢	Task 1.1: Cracking numeric passwords (up to 5 characters).
â€¢	Task 1.2: Cracking passwords with letters (upper/lowercase, max 5 characters).
â€¢	Task 1.3: Cracking 6-character alphanumeric passwords (GPU recommended).
ðŸ›  Tools Used:
â€¢	Hashcat & John the Ripper for brute-force attacks.
â€¢	GPU acceleration (where applicable) for faster computation.
ðŸ“Œ Findings:
â€¢	Short passwords (â‰¤6 characters) are highly vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
â€¢	GPU acceleration significantly speeds up cracking time.

2. Cracking Passwords (Dictionary Method)
â€¢	Task 2.1: Cracking MD5 hashes with RockYou-50 dictionary.
â€¢	Task 2.2: Cracking SHA-512 hashes with RockYou-50 dictionary.
ðŸ›  Tools Used:
â€¢	Hashcat & John the Ripper with RockYou-50 wordlist.
ðŸ“Œ Findings:
â€¢	Many passwords are easily cracked using common wordlists.
â€¢	MD5 is weaker compared to SHA-512 but still vulnerable to dictionary attacks.

3. Analyzing HTTP Traffic
â€¢	Capturing network traffic using Wireshark.
â€¢	Logging into an unencrypted website (http://testphp.vulnweb.com/login.php).
â€¢	Identifying login credentials in network packets.
â€¢	Comparing with secure sites like Facebook.
ðŸ“Œ Findings:
â€¢	HTTP traffic is unencrypted, making it easy to steal credentials via packet sniffing.
â€¢	HTTPS encrypts data, preventing password leaks.

4. SSH Traffic Analysis
â€¢	Monitoring an SSH connection between Kali Linux and another machine.
â€¢	Uploading secret1.txt and secret2.txt via FTP.
â€¢	Checking if file contents can be captured.
ðŸ“Œ Findings:
â€¢	SSH traffic is encrypted, preventing attackers from easily extracting credentials or file contents.

5. FTP Traffic Analysis
â€¢	Using Wireshark to monitor FTP file transfers.
â€¢	Uploading & downloading text files between two machines.
â€¢	Checking if file contents appear in captured network traffic.
ðŸ“Œ Findings:
â€¢	FTP transmits data in plain text, making it vulnerable to interception.
â€¢	SFTP (Secure FTP) or SCP should be used instead.
